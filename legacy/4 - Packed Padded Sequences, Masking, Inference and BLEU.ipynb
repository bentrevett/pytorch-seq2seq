    "# 4 - Packed Padded Sequences, Masking, Inference and BLEU\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be adding a few improvements - packed padded sequences and masking - to the model from the previous notebook. Packed padded sequences are used to tell our RNN to skip over padding tokens in our encoder. Masking explicitly forces the model to ignore certain values, such as attention over padded elements. Both of these techniques are commonly used in NLP. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also look at how to use our model for inference, by giving it a sentence, seeing what it translates it as and seeing where exactly it pays attention to when translating each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll use the BLEU metric to measure the quality of our translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll import all the modules as before, with the addition of the `matplotlib` modules used for viewing the attention."

This is a **[batch size, source sentence length]** tensor that is 1 when the source sentence token is not a padding token, and 0 when it is a padding token.

This fills the tensor at each element where the first argument (`mask == 0`) is true, with the value given by the second argument (`-1e10`). In other words, it will take the un-normalized attention values, and change the attention values over padded elements to be `-1e10`. As these numbers will be miniscule compared to the other values they will become zero when passed through the `softmax` layer, ensuring no attention is payed to padding tokens in the source sentence."

    "Previously we have only cared about the loss/perplexity of the model. However there metrics that are specifically designed for measuring the quality of a translation - the most popular is *BLEU*. Without going into too much detail, BLEU looks at the overlap in the predicted and actual target sequences in terms of their n-grams. It will give us a number between 0 and 1 for each sequence, where 1 means there is perfect overlap, i.e. a perfect translation, although is usually shown between 0 and 100. BLEU was designed for multiple candidate translations per source sequence, however in this dataset we only have one candidate per source.\n",
    "\n",
