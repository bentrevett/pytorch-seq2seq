    "# 1 - Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series we'll be building a machine learning model to go from once sequence to another, using PyTorch and TorchText. This will be done on German to English translations, but the models can be applied to any problem that involves going from one sequence to another, such as summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first notebook, we'll start simple to understand the general concepts by implementing the model from the [Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are *encoder-decoder* models, which (commonly) use a *recurrent neural network* (RNN) to *encode* the source (input) sentence into a single vector. In this notebook, we'll refer to this single vector as a *context vector*. You can think of the context vector as being an abstract representation of the input sentence in the source language. This vector is then *decoded* by a second RNN which learns to output the target (output) sentence by generating one word at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/seq2seq1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The input/source sentence \"guten morgen\" is input into the encoder (green) one word at a time. We also append a \"start of sequence\" (`<sos>`) and \"end of sequence\" (`<eos>`) token to the start and end of sentence, respectively. At each time-step, the input to the encoder RNN is both the current word, $x_t$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $h_{t-1}$, and the encoder RNN outputs a new hidden state $h_t$. You can think of the RNN as a function of both of these inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_t = \\text{RNN}(x_t, h_{t-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using the term RNN generally here, it could be any recurrent architecture, such as an *LSTM* (Long Short-Term Memory) or a *GRU* (Gated Recurrent Unit). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have $x_1 = \\text{<sos>}, x_2 = \\text{guten}$, etc. The initial hidden state, $h_0$, is usually either initialized to zeros or a learned parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the final word, $x_T$, has been passed into the RNN, we use the final hidden state, $h_T$, as the context vector, i.e. $h_T = z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have our context vector, we can start decoding it to get the output/target sentence, \"good morning\". Again, we append start and end of sequence tokens to the target sentence. At each time-step, the input to the decoder RNN (blue) is the current word, $y_t$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $s_{t-1}$, where the initial decoder hidden state, $s_0$, is the context vector, $s_0 = z = h_T$, i.e. the initial decoder hidden state is the final encoder hidden state. \n",
    "\n",
    "At each time-step we also use $s_t$ to predict (by passing it through a `Linear` layer, shown in purple) what we think is the next word in the sequence, $\\hat{y}_t$. We always use `<sos>` for $y_1$, but for $y_{>1}$ we will sometimes use the actual next word in the sequence, $y_t$ and sometimes use the last predicted word, $\\hat{y}_{t-1}$. This is called *teacher forcing*, and you can read about it more [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/teacher-forcing-for-recurrent-neural-networks/).\n",
    "\n",
    "When training/testing our model, we always know how many words are in our target sentence, so we stop generating words once we hit that many. During inference (i.e. real world usage) it is common to keep generating words until the model outputs an `<eos>` token or after a certain amount of words have been generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our predicted target sentence, $\\hat{Y} = \\{ \\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2, ..., \\hat{y}_T \\}$, we compare it against our actual target sentence, $Y = \\{ y_1, y_2, ..., y_T \\}$, to calculate our loss. We then use this loss to update all of the parameters in our model.\n",

    "First, the encoder, a 2 layer LSTM. The paper we are implementing uses a 4-layer LSTM, but in the interest of training time we cut this down to 2-layers. The concept of multi-layer RNNs is easy to expand from 2 to 4 layers. \n",

    "For a multi-layer RNN, the input sentence goes into the first (bottom) layer of the RNN and hidden states output by this layer are used as inputs to the next layer of RNNs. This means we'll also need an initial hidden state, $h_0$, per layer and we will also output a context vector, $z$, per layer. Both of the context vectors will be different, ideally we should denote the context vectors by $z_l$, where $l$ indicates which layer the context vector comes from, however I've omitted this in the interest of keeping the images clear by not adding a layer subscript everywhere.\n",

    "Without going into too much detail about LSTMs (see [this](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) blog post if you want to learn more about them), all we need to know is that they're a type of RNN which instead of just taking in a hidden state and returning a new hidden state, also take in and return a *cell state*, $c$. \n",

    "- `input_dim` is the size/dimensionality of the one-hot vectors that will be input to the encoder. This is equal to the input (source) vocabulary size.\n",
    "- `emb_dim` is the dimensionality of the embedding layer. This layer converts the one-hot vectors into dense vectors with `emb_dim` dimensions. \n",

You may notice that we do not pass an initial hidden or cell state to the RNN. This is because, as noted in the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.LSTM), that if no hidden/cell state is passed to the RNN, it will automatically create an initial hidden/cell state as a tensor of all zeros. \n",

We do not pass an initial hidden or cell state to the RNN, which PyTorch interprets as initializing them both to a tensor of all zeros. \n",

This is not always the case, you do not necessarily need the same number of layers or the same hidden dimension sizes in a sequence-to-sequence model. However, if you do something like having a different number of layers you will need to make decisions about how this is handled. For example, if your encoder has 2 layers and your decoder only has 1, how is this handled? Do you average the two context vectors output by the decoder? Do you pass both through a linear layer? Do you only use the context vector from the highest layer? Etc.\n",

    "Our `forward` method takes the source sentence, target sentence and a teacher-forcing ratio. The teacher forcing ratio is used when training our model. When decoding, at each time-step we will predict what the next token in the target sequence will be from the previous tokens decoded. With probability equal to the teaching forcing ratio (`teacher_forcing_ratio`) we will use the actual ground-truth next token in the sequence as the input to the decoder during the next time-step. However, with probability `1 - teacher_forcing_ratio`, we will use the token that the model predicted as the next input to the model, even if it doesn't match the actual next token in the sequence.  \n",
